This project focuses on designing and implementing a data warehouse solution, featuring a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 loader for maintaining historical data changes. The project showcases fundamental concepts in data warehousing, such as schema design, incremental data loading, and tracking historical data. It provides a strong foundation for understanding ETL processes, database design, and advanced SQL techniques.

Key Highlights:

Implementation of a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 loader using SQL Server stored procedures.
Dynamic handling of source and target table metadata for adaptability.
Comprehensive handling of insert, update, and historical data tracking for warehouse tables.
Modular and reusable SQL procedures for incremental data loading.
Foundation for extending the project with advanced data warehouse concepts such as partitioning and indexing.
